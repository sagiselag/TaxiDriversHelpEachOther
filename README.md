# TaxiDriversHelpEachOther

Android app for trading leads between taxi drivers I'm developing. 
The application uses Google Firebase as a database with SMS authentication, cloud Firestore, real-time database, functions with scheduled tasks, etc. 
Also, I have used BroadcastReceiver, background services, async tasks, notifications, internal storage, ViewPager2, drawer menu, fragments, etc.
